Dear Metors,

I have finished my final project and submited all required files to you.
Now, I am using the strategy of the rolling deployment and using rolling update for the docker image version
 when pass to the same of FRONT_NEW_VERSION_TAG or add new version for the docker image version when pass to
a new value of FRONT_NEW_VERSION_TAG 
About Kubernetes, I am using cloudformation to create cluster and group node. I choose a deployment with type
of Loadbancer.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks and Best Regards

Yours Faithfully

Buyn
